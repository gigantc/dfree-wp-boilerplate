= Limit login attempts done right =

By default, WordPress allows unlimited login attempts through the login form, XML-RPC or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords to be cracked with relative ease via brute force attack.

WP Cerber blocks intruders by IP or subnet from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making brute force attacks or distributed brute force attacks from botnets impossible.

You will be able to create a **Black IP Access List** or **White IP Access List** to block or allow logins from a particular IP address, IP address range or a subnet any class (A,B,C).

Moreover, you can create your Custom login page and forget about automatic attacks to the default wp-login.php, which takes your attention and consumes a lot of server resources. If an attacker tries to access wp-login.php they will be blocked and get a 404 Error response.

= Malware scanner =

Cerber Security Scanner is a sophisticated and extremely powerful tool that thoroughly scans every folder and inspects every file on a website for traces of malware, trojans, backdoors, changed and new files.

[Read more about malware scanner](https://wpcerber.com/wordpress-security-scanner/).

= Integrity checker =

The scanner checks if all WordPress folders and files match what exist in the official WordPress core repository, compares your plugins and themes with what are in the official WordPress repository and alerts you to any changes. As with scanning free plugins and themes, the scanner scans and verifies commercial plugins and themes that are installed manually.

= Automated recurring scans and email reporting =

Cerber Security Scanner allows you to easily configure your schedule for automated recurring scanning. Once the schedule is configured the scanner will automatically perform the scan of the website and send a email report with results of the scan.

[Read more about automated scans](https://wpcerber.com/automated-recurring-malware-scans/).

= Log, filter out and export activities =

WP Cerber tracks time, IP addresses and usernames for successful and failed login attempts, logins, logouts, password changes, blocked IP and actions taken by itself. You can export them to a CSV file.

= Limit login attempts reinvented =

You can **hide WordPress dashboard** (/wp-admin/) when a user isn't logged in. If a user isn't logged in and they attempt to access the dashboard by requesting /wp-admin/, WP Cerber will return a 404 Error.

Massive botnet brute force attack? That's no longer a problem. **Citadel mode** will automatically be activated for awhile and prevent your site from making further attempts to log in with any username.

= Cerber antispam engine =

Anti-spam and anti-bot protection for contact, registration, comments and other forms.
Cerber antispam and bot detection engine now protects all forms on a website. No reCAPTCHA is needed.
It’s compatible with virtually any form you have. Tested with Caldera Forms, Gravity Forms, Contact Form 7, Ninja Forms, Formidable Forms, Fast Secure Contact Form, Contact Form by WPForms.

= Anti-spam protection: invisible reCAPTCHA for WooCommerce =

* WooCommerce login form
* WooCommerce register form
* WooCommerce lost password form

= Anti-spam protection: invisible reCAPTCHA for WordPress =

* WordPress login form
* WordPress register form
* WordPress lost password form
* WordPress comment form

== Installation ==

Installing the WP Cerber Security & Antispam plugin is the same as other WordPress plugins.

1. Install the plugin through Plugins > Add New > Upload or unzip plugin package into wp-content/plugins/.
2. Activate the WP Cerber through the Plugins > Installed Plugins menu in the WordPress admin dashboard.
3. The plugin is now active and has started protecting your WordPress with default settings.
4. Make sure, that you've got a notification letter to your site admin email.
5. It's advised to enable Standard mode for the "Load security engine" setting.
5. Read carefully: [Getting Started Guide](https://wpcerber.com/getting-started/)

**Important notes**

1. Before enabling invisible reCAPTCHA, you must obtain separate keys for the invisible version. [How to enable reCAPTCHA](https://wpcerber.com/how-to-setup-recaptcha/).
2. If you want to test out plugin's features, do this on another computer (or incognito browser window) and remove computer IP address or network from the White Access List. Cerber is smart enough to recognize "the boss".
3. If you've set up the Custom login URL and you use some caching plugin like **W3 Total Cache** or **WP Super Cache**, you have to add the new Custom login URL to the list of pages not to cache.
4. [Read this if your website is under CloudFlare](https://wpcerber.com/cloudflare-and-wordpress-cerber/)
5. If you use the Jetpack plugin or another plugin that needs to connect to wordpress.com, you need to unlock XML-RPC. To do that go to the Hardening tab, uncheck Disable XML-RPC, and click the Save changes button.

The following steps are optional but they allow you to reinforce the protection of your WordPress.

1. Fine tune **Limit login attempts** settings making them more restrictive according to your needs
2. Configure your **Custom login URL** and remember it (the plugin will send you an email with it).
3. Once you have configured Custom login URL, check 'Immediately block IP after any request to wp-login.php' and 'Block direct access to wp-login.php and return HTTP 404 Not Found Error'. Don't use wp-admin to log in to your WordPress dashboard anymore.
4. If your WordPress has a few experienced users, check 'Immediately block IP when attempting to log in with a non-existent username'.
5. Specify the list of prohibited usernames (logins) that legit users will never use. They will not be permitted to log in or register.
6. Configure mobile and browser notifications via Pushbullet.
7. Obtain keys and enable invisible reCAPTCHA for password reset and registration forms (WooCommerce supported too).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin with CloudFlare? =

Yes.  [WP Cerber settings for CloudFlare](https://wpcerber.com/cloudflare-and-wordpress-cerber/).

= Is WP Cerber Security compatible with WordPress multisite mode? =

Yes. All settings apply to all sites in the network simultaneously. You have to activate the plugin in the Network Admin area on the Plugins page. Just click on the Network Activate link.

= Is WP Cerber Security compatible with bbPress? =

Yes. [Compatibility notes](https://wpcerber.com/compatibility/).

= Is WP Cerber Security compatible with WooCommerce? =

Completely.

= Is reCAPTCHA for WooCommerce free feature? =

Yes. [How to set up reCAPTCHA for WooCommerce](https://wpcerber.com/how-to-setup-recaptcha/).

= Are there any incompatible plugins? =

The following plugins can cause some issues: Ultimate Member, WPBruiser {no- Captcha anti-Spam}, Plugin Organizer, WP-SpamShield.
The Cerber Security plugin won't be updated to fix any issue or conflict related to them, you should decide and stop using one or all of them.
Read more: [https://wpcerber.com/compatibility/](https://wpcerber.com/compatibility/).

= Can I change login URL (rename wp-login.php)? =

Yes, easily. [How to rename wp-login.php](https://wpcerber.com/how-to-rename-wp-login-php/)

= Can I hide the wp-admin folder? =

Yes, easily. [How to hide wp-admin and wp-login.php from possible attacks](https://wpcerber.com/how-to-hide-wp-admin-and-wp-login-php-from-possible-attacks/)

= Can I rename the wp-admin folder? =

Nope. It's not possible and not recommended for compatibility reasons.

= Can I hide the fact I use WordPress? =

No. We strongly encourage you not to use any plugin that renames wp-admin folder to protect a website.
 Beware of all plugins that hide WordPress folders or other parts of a website and claim this as a security feature.
 They are not capable to protect your website. Don't be silly, hiding some stuff doesn't make your site more secure.

= Can WP Cerber Security work together with the Limit Login Attempts plugin? =

Nope. WP Cerber is a drop in replacement for that outdated plugin.

= Can WP Cerber Security protect my site from DDoS attacks? =

Nope. The plugin protects your site from Brute force attacks or distributed Brute force attacks. By default WordPress allows unlimited login attempts either through the login form or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords to be cracked with relative ease via a brute force attack. To prevent from such a bad situation use WP Cerber.

= Is there any WordPress plugin to protect my site from DDoS attacks? =

Nope. This hard task cannot be done by using a plugin. That may be done by using special hardware from your hosting provider.

= What is the goal of Citadel mode? =

Citadel mode is intended to block massive bot (botnet) attacks and also a slow brute force attack. The last type of attack has a large range of intruder IPs with a small number of attempts to login per each.

= How to turn off Citadel mode completely? =

Set Threshold fields to 0 or leave them empty.

= What is the goal of using Fail2Ban? =

With Fail2Ban you can protect site on the OS level with iptables firewall. See details here: [https://wpcerber.com/how-to-protect-wordpress-with-fail2ban/](https://wpcerber.com/how-to-protect-wordpress-with-fail2ban/)

= Do I need to use Fail2Ban to get the plugin working? =

No, you don't. It is optional.

= Is WP Cerber Security compatible with other security plugins like WordFence, iThemes Security, Sucuri, NinjaFirewall, All In One WP Security & Firewall, BulletProof Security? =

The plugin has been tested with WordFence and no issues have been noticed. Other plugins also should be compatible.

= Can I use this plugin on the WP Engine hosting? =

Yes! WP Cerber Security is not on the list of disallowed plugins.

= Is the plugin compatible with Cloudflare? =

Yes, read more: https://wpcerber.com/cloudflare-and-wordpress-cerber/

= Does the plugin works on websites with SSL(HTTPS) =

Absolutely!

= It seems that old activity records are not removing from the activity log =

That means that scheduled tasks are not executed on your site. In other words, WordPress cron is not working the right way.
Try to add the following line to your wp-config.php file:

define( 'ALTERNATE_WP_CRON', true );

= I'm unable to log in / I'm locked out of my site / How to get access (log in) to the dashboard? =

There is a special version of the plugin called **WP Cerber Reset**. This version performs only one task. It resets all WP Cerber settings to their initial values (excluding Access Lists) and then deactivates itself.

To get access to your dashboard you need to copy the WP Cerber Reset folder to the plugins folder. Follow these simple steps.

1. Download the wp-cerber-reset.zip archive to your computer using this link: [https://wpcerber.com/downloads/wp-cerber-reset.zip](https://wpcerber.com/downloads/wp-cerber-reset.zip)
2. Unpack wp-cerber folder from the archive.
3. Upload the wp-cerber folder to the **plugins** folder of your site using any FTP client or a file manager from your hosting control panel. If you see a question about overwriting files, click Yes.
4. Log in to your site as usually. Now WP Cerber is disabled completely.
5. Reinstall the WP Cerber plugin again. You need to do that, because **WP Cerber Reset** cannot work as a normal plugin.

== Other Notes ==

**What does "Cerber" mean?**

Cerber is derived from the name Cerberus. In Greek and Roman mythology, Cerberus is a multi-headed dog with a serpent's tail, a mane of snakes, and a lion's claws. Nobody can bypass this angry dog. Now you can order WP Cerber to guard the entrance to your site too.
